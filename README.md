# SQLit
**Welcome!**
First, what is SQLit? SQL-it is a project of mine that I just envisioned last January 15, 2024. This is my first project of the month and yeah, I hope to finish this one in a week xD.
Anyways, what would be the purpose of this web app? I took a course (Database Management System) which dives into sql side of coding.. Creating tables, Inserting values are quite of an effort just to copy paste it one by one in excel, and if one is typing it by hand.. You are a true soldier xD cuz that could be alot of work. Also as someone that isn't a computer, I am prone to errors at even copypasting and sure is exhausting. So I came up to a plan since I'm currently learning javascript as a refresher, why not create something I could use in my next course which is the ADBMS. Yeah, I know this isn't new as there's alot of converters out there and for sure WAy waY better than this project of mine but hey, at least I am sure I won't have any virus of any sorts if I just created mine? XDD jk, so yeah that is I guess a usual "norms" if there is a site offering a free converter which Im pretty sure others are just helping out for good but we aren't sure of others, its better to be sure lmao. Lastly, given than if I am the one who created my own converter, I've got the power to modify my website if ever I will be encountering some scenarios where I need to change for example double quotations" to single quotes' what not. Yeah enough with the novel, cuz I'm not even sure if I will be able to complete this simple project xD.
